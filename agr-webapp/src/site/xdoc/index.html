             Transactional Archiving consists of selectively capturing and storing transactions that take place  between a web client (browser) and a web server.  </p>
             <p>Most existing web archives recurrently send out bots to crawl the content of web servers. This results in observations of a server's content at the time of crawling. Since the crawling frequency is generally not aligned with the change rate of a server's resources, this approach is typically not able to capture all versions of a server's resource. The resulting archive may provide an acceptable overview of a server's evolution over time, but it will not provide an accurate representation of the server's entire history. A Transactional Web Archive, however, captures every version of a resource as it is being requested by a browser.  The resulting archive is effectively representative of a server's entire history, although versions of resources that are never requested by a browser will also never be archived. </p>


            <p>The Transactional Web Archive  provides the following opportunities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dynamic Archiving of your Apache Web Content Server</li>
                <li>Comforms to Memento Framework </li>
                <li>Compatible with  data offload to Wayback</li>
            </ul>
